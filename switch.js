 * ╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
 * ║                    SWITCH PLUGIN v2.0.0                       ║
 * ╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
 *
 * ─── PURPOSE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Manages player team-change requests with cooldown enforcement,
 * scramble-aware lockout, and persistent join-timer tracking across
 * server restarts. Integrates with TeamBalancer to lock switching
 * after scrambles and with SlackersSquadServices for player state
 * tracking and attribution. Uses _requestTeamChange() retry/verify
 * from S3DiscordPluginBase, and getSecondsFromJoin() /
 * getSecondsFromMatchStart() for join-time awareness. Supports
 * in-game chat commands and Discord admin commands.
 *
 * ─── EXPORTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Switch (default)
 *   Extends S3DiscordPluginBase. Key public methods:
 *     mount()                          — Registers event listeners and initializes state.
 *     unmount()                        — Removes listeners, clears queue, unregisters S³ interest.
 *     switchPlayer(eosID)              — Executes AdminForceTeamChange via RCON for one player.
 *     doubleSwitchPlayer(eosID, forced, senderSteamID) — Swaps a player to the opposite team and back.
 *     switchSquad(number, team)        — Switches all members of a squad to the opposite team.
 *     doubleSwitchSquad(number, team)  — Double-switches all members of a squad.
 *     getDiagnosticInfo()              — Returns DB health, active lock count, and stored player count.
 *     checkPlayer(ident)               — Looks up a player's cooldown/lock state by eosID or name.
 *     cleanup()                        — Purges expired cooldown rows from the database.
 *     getPlayersByUsername(username)   — Fuzzy player search by name substring.
 *     getPlayerBySteamID(steamID)      — Exact player lookup by SteamID.
 *     getPlayerByUsernameOrSteamID(ident) — Combined lookup with ambiguity warnings.
 *     getSecondsFromJoin(eosID)        — Seconds since player joined (via S³).
 *     getSecondsFromMatchStart()       — Seconds since current layer started.
 *     getTeamBalanceDifference()       — Returns signed team-size delta (Team1 − Team2).
 *     getSwitchSlotsPerTeam(teamID, effectiveCap) — Available switch slots for a given team.
 *     addPlayerToMatchendSwitches(p)   — Queues a player for end-of-round team switch.
 *     addSquadToMatchendSwitches(n, t) — Queues an entire squad for end-of-round switch.
 *     onChatMessage(info)              — Handles all in-game !switch / !change / double-switch commands.
 *     onDiscordMessage(message)        — Handles Discord !switch admin commands.
 *     onRoundEnded(info)               — Processes end-of-round switch queue.
 *     onScrambleExecuted(data)         — Applies scramble lockdown to affected players.
 *     onNewGame()                      — Logs new-game transition, starts broadcast timers.
 *     onS3PlayerJoined(data)           — Triggers rejoin auto-switch, queue processing, and join warn.
 *     onS3PlayerLeft(data)             — Removes player from queue, triggers queue processing.
 *     onS3PlayerTeamChanged(data)      — Triggers queue processing on team change.
 *
 * ─── DEPENDENCIES ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * S3DiscordPluginBase (./s3-discord-plugin-base.js)
 *   SquadJS base class providing Discord connector, server, options, and S³ lifecycle.
 *
 * ─── S³ INTEGRATION ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * DB models are managed via S³ MigrationEngine . Tables
 * (SwitchPlugin_PlayerCooldowns, SwitchPlugin_Endmatches) are created
 * through version-tracked migrations on the S³ connector, replacing
 * the old createModel() / sync({alter}) / raw ALTER TABLE pattern.
 * All transactions use s3db.withTransactionWithRetry().
 *
 * S³ (Slacker's Squad Services) is the centralised service container
 * for shared state across Slacker's Squad plugins.  It owns the
 * ground truth for server configuration, game-state lifecycle,
 * player state, faction metadata, clan grouping, database access,
 * and cross-plugin event routing.  Consumer plugins discover S³ at
 * runtime via this.server.plugins and access services through flat
 * getters (e.g. this._s3?.gameState) guarded by isReady() checks.
 *
 * GitHub: https://github.com/mikebjoyce/squadjs-slackers-squad-services
 *
 * Consumed Services:
 *   - players:  registerRefreshInterest(), unregisterRefreshInterest(),
 *               getPlayer(), recordMove(), canAct(), requestRefresh() —
 *               player join-time resolution, move attribution,
 *               concurrency gating, and stale-data refresh polling.
 *   - gameState: getLayerName(), isEndgameFactionVote() — liberal-mode
 *               detection and faction-vote queue suppression.
 *   - serverConfig: getAllowTeamChanges() — detects whether scoreboard
 *               team changes are disabled.
 *
 * Emitted Events:
 *   - None.
 *
 * Listened Events:
 *   - S3_PLAYER_JOINED: triggers rejoin auto-switch, queue processing, and join warn.
 *   - S3_PLAYER_LEFT: stores disconnection state; removes player from switch queue.
 *   - S3_PLAYER_TEAM_CHANGED: triggers queue re-evaluation.
 *   - TEAM_BALANCER_SCRAMBLE_EXECUTED: applies scramble lockdown to affected
 *     players for a configurable duration.
 *
 * ─── NOTES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * - Forked from the original SquadJS Switch plugin by fantinodavide.
 *   Original author credit retained.
 * - Scramble lockdown skips players still within their switch-enabled
 *   window (join or match start), since they had no time to exploit
 *   pre-scramble imbalance.
 * - Liberal game modes (default: Seed, Jensen) relax cooldown and time
 *   limits. Configured via liberalSwitchGameModes and
 *   liberalSwitchMaxUnbalancedSlots.
 * - Dynamic balance tolerance scales extra imbalance slots linearly
 *   from dynamicBalancePlayerFloor (default 90) up to 98 players.
 * - Switch queue uses a stability gate: solo switches are only
 *   processed when team counts are stable across two consecutive polls.
 * - RCON identifier cascade: player name is the only universally
 *   reliable RCON identifier. eosID/steamID are NOT valid for RCON.
 * - DB transaction retry (via s3db.withTransactionWithRetry()) handles
 *   SQLITE_BUSY with retry+jitter.
 * - PlayerCooldowns table is version-tracked via S³ MigrationEngine
 *   — no more sync({alter}) or drop-and-recreate.
 * - Endmatch switch queue persists across restarts via the
 *   SwitchPlugin_Endmatches table; processed on ROUND_ENDED.
 * - Broadcast timers and join-warn timeouts are cleaned up in unmount().
 * - JOIN_WARN_DELAY_MS constant controls the delay before showing
 *   ChangeTeam-disabled warning to joining players (90s default).
 *
